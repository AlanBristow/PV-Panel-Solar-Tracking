The focus of this project is to investigate the impact of implementing solar tracking with two
degrees of freedom compared to a fixed stationary panel. With the growing need to increase the
use and production of renewable energy due to the increasing severity on global warming this
project aims to investigate if modifications to existing solar systems could achieve an effective
gain in power generation. The approach taken was to make a standalone scaled device that
would implement solar tracking using a solar position algorithm and compare the difference in
power generation while considering the power consumption of the servos and the current
weather conditions. The resulting answer was that an increase up to 71% extra power
generation could be achieved and the system stood out strongest when the weather conditions
were partly cloudy. The conclusions of this project were that there are strong signs to
implementing solar tracking over fixed systems and that there is a benefit to these systems in
areas that receive higher percentage cloud coverage throughout the year.
